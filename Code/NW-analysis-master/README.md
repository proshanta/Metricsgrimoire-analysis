# Network family metrics calculator

Working Principle :-

Let the user select a folder location with one or more Pajek files.
Let the user select one or more metrics from a set of network metrics (like degree centrality, average clustering coefficient, diameter, average degree, average separation, modularity)
For the Pajek files in the folder, calculate the selected metrics for each vertex, and output one CSV files (each row for each Pajek file, the column heads should be degree centrality, average clustering coefficient, ...)
in the same folder
Steps to run the Script :-

1) Open Rstudio and run the R file
2 ) Give the folder location of the pajek file
3) Choose options where space is a separator , for all choose all options (i.e. 1 2 3 4 5 6 )

# Network vertex metrics calculator -

Working Principle-

Let the user select a folder location with one or more Pajek files.
Let the user select one or more metrics from a set of vertex metrics (the same vertex metrics like degree, betweenness, closeness, Pagerank. clustering coefficient etc, you already have)
For the Pajek files in the folder, calculate the selected metircs for each vertex, and output a set of CSV files (one for each Pajek file, named as -metrics.csv - the column heads should be vertex id, and each me) in the same folder
Steps to run the Script :-

1) Open Rstudio and run the R file
2 ) Give the folder location of the pajek file
3) Choose options where space is a separator , for all choose all options (i.e. 1 2 3 4 5 6 )

# Network_vertex_metrics_visualizer - 

Working Principle:-

Let the user select a folder location with one or more CSV file (generated by the component a above i.e Network vertex metrics calculator)
Let the user select one or more metrics from those in the CSV file
Draw histograms of the selected metric for all the networks (i.e. number of CSV files present at the folder location)

Steps:-
1) Copy the folder named Network_vertex_metrics_visualizer in your current R workspace
2) Open RStudio and then write
3) runApp("Network_vertex_metrics_visualizer")

Folder Name- Network_vertex_metrics_visualizer


# Network_family_metrics_visualizer -

Working Principle:-

Let the user select a folder location with one CSV file (generated by the component a above i.e Network family metrics calculator)
Let the user select one or more metrics from those in the CSV file
Draw line plot of the selected metrics for all the networks (i.e. number of CSV files present at the folder location)

Steps:-
1) Copy the folder named Network_family_metrics_visualizer in your current R workspace
2) Open RStudio and then write
3) runApp("Network_family_metrics_visualizer")

Folder Name- Network_family_metrics_visualizer
